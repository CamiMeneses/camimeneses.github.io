          <p>
            I began my journey as Web Developer since <b> 2019 </b> with Bogot√° Dev & Bootcamp
            where I learnt the basics of multiples languages<br />
            <br />

            I've been working mainly as <b>Ruby on Rails</b> developer, with <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>.
            Used <b>Git</b>, and code hosting platforms like <b>Github</b> and <b>Bitbucket</b><br />
            <br />

            I want to keep learning about this world of development <br />
            and even when I've been focused on back-end, I like the front-end part
            so then I'm studying <b>JS</b> and its frameworks like <b>React JS</b>, which I'm using here!<br />
            <br />

            Check out my website, learn more about me <br />
            and feel free to <b>contact me</b>. <br />
